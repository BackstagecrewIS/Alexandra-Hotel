* Design Considerations
  - Colour Scheme
    The main colours on the pub sign are blue and gold. The colour scheme should reflect this
    
  - Typography
    To ensure clarity of text on the website, a sans serif font is preferred.
    The Poppins font has a variety of sizes available and will be used with Sans Serif as a backup in case the desired font fails to load.
    The header should reflect the font and text used on the pub sign. This is a gold coloured serif font on a blue background.
    
  - Imagery
    A large hero image of the pub at the top of the landing page will serve to illustrate the pub and to reassure that the visitor is looking at the correct site
    A heading which includes a representation of the pub sign will further reinforce the brand image od the pub

  - Rule of Thirds
    Using the Rule of Thirds techniques will give the page better clarity and balance

## Design Strategy

### The strategy plane:
**What are you aiming to achieve in the first place and for whom?**

The website is for The Alexandra Hotel as a simple online advertisement of what is available when a customer visits the pub.

The users will be a mixture of local regular visitors and tourists / travellers visiting the area.

### The scope plane:
**Which features, based on information from the strategy plane, do you want to include in your design?**

#### Must Have
A welcome message and some information about the pub.

The pub serves a range of regular beers and would like to give information about each of them. This will be the name of the brewery, the beer name, the abv (strength) and some tasting notes. A picture of the pump clip will help the visitor locate the beer on the bar.

The pub serves a large range of continental bottled beers and would like to have a list of these available. This can be provided using a link to download a pdf from the beers page.

The pub has three guest rooms where visitors can stay the night and would like to show information about them.

#### Could Have
A simple contact form would be useful for people to enquire about room bookings.

A map and directions to the pub is desireable.

#### Future plans
In the future it would be desirable for the landlord to be able to update the guest beers on the site without having to resort to coding.

#### Usability
Most users are assumed to be accessing the site on a mobile device so the site should adopt a mobile first design.

Users should be able to navigate the site without difficulty so navigation should be intuitive.

For the initial build, this site will incorporate:
* Welcome message and information about the pub
* A list of regularly available beers with details
* A downloadable list of continental beers
* Some information about the available rooms and facilities
* Information and directions to the pub with a local map showing the location
* A contact form to email enquiries

Future Development:
* Add a method to add and remove guest beers to the beer list (methodology to be determined)
* Link beers to Untappd.com so users can 'check in' the beers they are drinking

### The structure plane:
**How is the information structured and how is it logically grouped?**

The information should be grouped by;

* Welcome and information
* Beers
* Rooms and facilities
* Location information and contact form

The landing page should contain a welcome message and basic information about the pub. There should also be a navigation area to other areas of the site.

The beer list should be on a separate page with a link to download the continental beer list.

Another page should show the rooms and facilities with a link to the contact page for enquiries.

Information and directions with a map should be on a fourth page. This page will contain the contact form.

All pages should have navigation links to the other pages.


### The skeleton plane:
**How will our information be represented, and how will the user navigate to the information and the features?**

index.html
The landing page will contain a welcome message and basic information about the pub. There should also be a navigation area to other areas of the site.

beers.html
The list of beers with a link to the pdf containing the list of continental beers

rooms.html
Information about the rooms and facilities with at least one image per room

contact.html
A contact form
A local area map and directions to the pub from the railway station and the bus station.
The directions will have images to help the user to begin their navigation

A navigation area must be included on each page to allow the user to move between pages
The links will all open in the same tab except for the link to the pdf which will open in a new tab.


### The surface plane:
**What will the finished product look like? What colors, typography, and design elements will we use?**
Wireframes for each of the pages are below:

<a href="/assets/wireframes/index.png" target="_blank">index.html Wireframe</a>

<a href="/assets/wireframes/beers.png" target="_blank">beers.html Wireframe</a>

<a href="/assets/wireframes/rooms.png" target="_blank">rooms.html Wireframe</a>

<a href="/assets/wireframes/contact.png" target="_blank">contact.html Wireframe</a>

The colour scheme of the pub sign is blue and gold while the building is painted white.
This can be reflected in the website by using a white background with blue and gold as a colour scheme for navigation menu items and buttons

## Features

### Responsive
The site must be designed to work on on all devices from mobile to desktop.

### Intuitive
Navigation and use of the website must be intuitive allowing the user to be able to use the website without instructions

First Time Visitor Goals

As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. 

Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a "Learn More" Call to action button.

The main points are made immediately with the hero image

The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.

As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. 
At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.

At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.

On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

Once the new visitor has read the About Us and What We Do text, they will notice the Why We are Loved So Much section.

The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.

At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Facebook Group link so that I can join and interact with others in the community.

The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.

Alternatively, the user can scroll to the bottom of the Home page to find the Facebook Group redirect card and can easily join by clicking the "Join Now!" button which like any external link, will open in a new tab to ensure they can get back to the website easily.

If the user is on the "Our Favourites" page they will also be greeted with a call to action button to invite the user to the Facebook group.

The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.

The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.

A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.

Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

Known Bugs

A white gap can be seen to the right of the footer and navigation bar as a result.

On Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer Browsers, all links in Navbar are pushed upwards when hovering over them.
